<h1>Description</h1>
<p><a href="http://igor.gold.ac.uk/~bcool001/portfolio/beer-dashboard/beer-dashboard.html">The London Beersource</a> is an interactive data dashboard of craft beer in London. It was created as a group project by four total members for the MSc Digital Journalism course at Goldsmiths, University of London. </p>

<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The dataset for the interactive map was sourced from a <a href="http://londonist.com/2015/02/mapped-londons-breweries-and-brewpubs-by-borough">Londonist blog post</a>. We started with their KML file and then manually added information about each of the 80 breweries (hours of opereration, recommended beers, notes, etc).
Our updated dataset can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yZg_1DYbCXARurBxQHlOEzJ8kAq1ASmvCJfKDHZZXWs/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

Live data on beer is drawn from the  <a href="http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/apps">BreweryDB API.</a>
</p>

<h1>Visualizations</h1>
<p>We built the dashboard using UIkit to create the different panels. The site is fully mobile responsive. Map was created using Google Charts API. </p>
